# landvault-governance

The LandVault Platform governance corpus — cross-cutting ADRs, the RFC
ratification process, and the LandVault Platform Steward role. Instruments
in this repo acquire authority through RFC ratification, not by assertion.

## Key Concepts

- Issues tracked in `~/git/landvault/landvault-management/issues/LVGOV-*.yaml`
- BACKLOG: `~/git/landvault/landvault-management/issues/BACKLOG.yaml` (filter: `LVGOV` prefix)
- Initiative brief: `~/git/landvault/landvault-management/projects/landvault-governance-corpus/initiative-brief.yaml`

## Agent Roles

Cage root: `~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/`

All relative paths in agent and skill files resolve to the cage root, not the
project directory.

**Coordinator session**: Before responding to any instruction, use the Read
tool to read `~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/agents/coordinator/agent.md` and
run the bootstrap orientation pass defined there, with these project-scoped
overrides:
- This is a **single-project coordinator**, not a portfolio coordinator.
- Filter the BACKLOG to the project's issue prefix (`LVGOV`) only.
- Being on a feature branch is normal and expected.

**Manager session** (on a track branch): When invoked with "Manage {ISSUE_ID}",
use the Read tool to read `~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/agents/manager/agent.md`
and execute the state machine defined there.

## Cage methodology

Agent roles, skills, and runbooks live in the cage repo. Reference by
absolute path:

~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/agents/<role>/agent.md
~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/skills/<skill>.md
~/git/landvault/landvault-cage/runbooks/<runbook>.md
